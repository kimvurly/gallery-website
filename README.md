<h1>☆kimberly's gallery of stuff!</h1>
like my instagram page but better and with more yapping :P
<br>
<br>
you can click on each image and it'll flip to show you a paragraph of lore for the image teehee. i had to search up quite a lot of stuff to figure out 
how to make the cards actually freaking flip and it was driving me insane this morning but then i figured it out and now i'm done with my project! also i may or may not 
have made this project so i can get enough athena award artifacts for some more steam games because the summer sale ends on july 10th and i NEED these games. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE
<br>
i didn't make it mobile friendly this time but i will continue working on this project and add a filtering mechanic cus that'd be super cool and then i'll maybe add an option where i can upload photos and write a background drop directly from the website instead of just coding it in so it'd be like a journal entry website that's kinda similar to instagram!! i will do all that after i get those steam games tho. those games are my priority right now.
