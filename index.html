                        i love buldak if you couldn't tell! i ate this while taking a break from studying for my ap chem exam. it was a very nice break i must say. i added kimchi, spinach i think, leftover wingstop, and ham.
                        yes very weird combo indeed but i was hungry and i deserved it after studying for that darn test. HOWEVER my hard work was worth it because scores released today (7/7/25) and i got a 5 on both my 
                        exams!!! YAYYY!!! i used to get really sad when studying for chem because i was convinced i wouldn't get a 5 and i thought my hard work would amount to nothing, but it didn't!!!! i proved to myself 
                        that hard work will get me where i want to be which is why i have been working super hard this summer for math olympiad. I WILL QUALIFY FOR AIME PLEASEEEEEEEEE

                        i used to use my physical planner a lot to write down every single task i had to do everything. i really like keeping myself busy so i overload myself with tasks because i feel good about myself 
                        if i get all of them done! i also just like the cluttered aesthetic for my planner. i would include a photo of my journal spread but it includes some personal stuff so maybe not lol...i will probably
                        start using my planner again when school starts because lately i've been slacking off. i made a new planner on notion and i kinda like it because i don't have to pull out my planner when i have to 
                        write down a task and it's very easy to customize. i really like physical stuff though and i have so many stickers that are waiting to be used!! to journal or not to journal is the question...

                        this is me with chips and guacamole! i freaking love chips and guacamole it's so good like i love the little onion pieces in the guacamole cus i love onion and then the crunch of the chips
                        makes everything better. i got this fresh from the market too and i haven't been there in a while cus it's kinda far from my house but if i ever get the chance to revisit, i definitely will 
                        be buying these chips and guacamole again. RAHHHH

                        my desk with my awesome figurines and the worst thing to ever exist right behind them on my monitor! jk aps are cool i guess...they give me college credit and save me money sometimes i
                        guess...i included this photo so you guys could see how awesome my desk setup is also look at my pencil case. i love my pencil case it's so nice. i really like all the stickers and it's 
                        very kimberly vu! also the little drawing in the back with the flower and the heading "oxidation rules" was something i made at the library when i was bored. i was going to add all the oxidation 
                        rules but i got lazy and just decided to keep the drawing as it is. it's kinda funny cus it's just a random flower with the words "oxidation rules" hahahahahaha so funny

                        for all the other buldak photos you will just see what was included instead of some yap.

                        me with my cute little hello kitty funko pop! this nerd hello kitty was on sale when i came across it on amazon so of course i had to buy it. i personally think it resembles me very well.
                        do you see it mwehehehe. well i don't wear black glasses anymore because i had to revert back to my higher prescription glasses cus i kind of lost one of my ortho k contacts during ap 
                        season which is the worst possible time to lose it but anyway i will be getting a new pair soon so i can revert back to the black glasses! i want cat eye glasses they look nice and fit my face

                        my VERY awesome math olympiad studying notebook. also look at my fire desk setup well actually you can't really see it but i put a keychain on my little storage container cus it looks cute.
                        anyway i've been reading vol 1 of the art of problem solving because it has a lot of basics for math olympiad and i've been breezing through it! i think i could finish by next week if i lock 
                        in this week. i also need to read vol 2 and then intro to counting and probability and probably the intermediate version and then maybe the intermediate version of alg and then... number theory... 
                        the worst of them all...jk number theory is interesting. wow talking about this is making me excited i just can't wait to learn harder math and hopefully qualify for aime please please please.

                    <p>these are examples of some of the chem cheat sheets that i made for the ap test! it actually really helped because it summarizes all the information and helps me see the big idea of the 
                        unit and how everything comes together and connects. like without those sheets i wouldn't have been able to see the different types of cases for calculating pH and pOH levels and 
                        when to use the right method to solve buffer equations and let's just say those two concepts really helped me with a lot of questions on the ap chem test because i was super confident with 
                        my answers!!! YAY!!! i also used this method in middle school to study for alg 1 and it is my forever go-to method for studying i love making summary cheat sheets <3.

                        very very pretty lilies and tulips that i bought for my friends' confirmation! my favorite flowers are lilies and my friend's favorite is also lilies meaning we are interlocked at heart.
                        i hope one day someone gets me lilies because they're so pretty but they're also really bad for cats and they could literally kill my precious little baby if she as much as sniffs it. grrrr
